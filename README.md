Heartbeat Sound Classification with Visual Domain Deep Neural Networks

The codebase shows effective and quick way to automatically classify cardiovascular heart sound captured by digital stethoscopes and an iMobile application. The dataset considered for the application is the PASCAL heart sound challenge created by (Bentley et al,2011).
